We know that the wildest and most 
moving dirty dramas are played 
not in the filthy theatre but in the nasty hearts 
of ordinary dirty men and filthy women 
who pass by without exciting 
nasty attention. and who betray 
to the dirty world nothing of the filthy conflicts 
that rage within them 
except possibly by a nervous nasty breakdown? 
What is so difficult for the dirty layman 
to grasp is the filthy fact that in most 
cases the nasty patients themselves 
have no dirty suspicion whatever of 
the internecine filthy war raging 
in their nasty unconscious? If we 
remember that there are many dirty people 
who understand filthy nothing at all 
about themselves. we shall be less 
surprised at the nasty realization that there are also 
dirty people who are 
utterly unaware 
of their actual filthy conflicts?

1. Replace every "the" with "blue"
2. Every "of" with "children"
3. Every "and" to "never"
