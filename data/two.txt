We know that the wildest and most 
moving dramas are played 
not in the theatre but in the hearts 
of ordinary men and women 
who pass by without exciting 
attention, and who betray 
to the world nothing of the conflicts 
that rage within them 
except possibly by a nervous breakdown. 
What is so difficult for the layman 
to grasp is the fact that in most 
cases the patients themselves 
have no suspicion whatever of 
the internecine war raging 
in their unconscious. If we 
remember that there are many people 
who understand nothing at all 
about themselves, we shall be less 
surprised at the realization that there are also 
people who are 
utterly unaware 
of their actual conflicts.
